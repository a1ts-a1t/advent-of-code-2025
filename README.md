you know what [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is. here's my work for 2025

## usage

you can compile if you want and run it from there, but i'm assuming if you're running this, you're runing this with cargo. in which case, run it with 

```sh
cargo run -- --day 1 # or whatever day you want
```

add your inputs into the corresponding `day[_].txt` input file.
